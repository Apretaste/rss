RSS News Aggregator for Apretaste

Internet access in Cuba is among the most regulated in the world. Most Cuban citizens have to spend somewhere around a quarter of their monthly salary per hour to access the Internet and can do so only at certain areas designated by the Cuban government, and they are typically unable to afford the cost of downloading or streaming more than a few megabytes per month.
Thus, this RSS News aggregation service allows quick access to up to date news offered by a number of RSS enabled news outlets, ranging from sports to politics.

To use this service:
Send an email to "apretaste@gmail.com" with the subject "noticias". After a few minutes, you should receive an email from apretaste@gmail.com with an email showing you the available categories of news to browse. Click on any one of them, and a new email will open up with the subject full list of sources (news sites) and articles for the desired category.
All articles are automatically translated to Spanish but also available in their original language.

To modify/test this service:

1. Download "sandbox.zip" from https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B8BgVCFpPBzRU2lUS0ZOdVRMdG8
2. Follow all the instructions in the "HOW-TO" document. The "COMO-HACER" file contains the instructions in Spanish.
3. Copy all files and sub-folders from the "php" folder to a folder titled "noticias".

5. Update the "service.php" file to point to the location of the RSS Aggregator Service.

Note: If your computer does not have a C: drive, you may be able to place the "apretaste" folder in your Desktop instead.
